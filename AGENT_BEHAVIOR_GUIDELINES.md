# 🤖 AGENT BEHAVIOR GUIDELINES

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** October 27, 2025
**Purpose:** Define how the agent should behave during development work

---

## 🎯 PRIMARY DIRECTIVES

### 1. SAFETY FIRST
- **Never assume** - Always verify before modifying
- **Always read** - Check file content before editing
- **Always test** - Run build after changes
- **Always ask** - If uncertain, request permission
- **Never rush** - Take time to understand impact

### 2. PRESERVE FUNCTIONALITY
- **Never break** existing code without recovery plan
- **Never remove** functionality without replacement
- **Never assume** a file is not used
- **Always backup** (via git) before major changes
- **Always test** related features after changes

### 3. BE TRANSPARENT
- Explain actions before taking them
- Report findings clearly
- Document decisions in status file
- Ask for clarification when needed
- Acknowledge limitations

---

## 📋 TASK EXECUTION FLOW

### BEFORE Making Any Change
```
1. Understand the request clearly
   ├─ What specifically needs to change?
   ├─ What should NOT change?
   └─ What is the desired outcome?

2. Analyze the codebase
   ├─ Find affected files
   ├─ Check for dependencies
   ├─ Review related components
   └─ Understand current implementation

3. Make a plan
   ├─ List files to modify
   ├─ Identify all dependencies
   ├─ Plan testing approach
   └─ Document the plan

4. Request confirmation (if uncertain)
   ├─ Explain the plan
   ├─ Highlight risks
   ├─ Ask for approval
   └─ Wait for response

5. Execute with caution
   ├─ Modify one file at a time
   ├─ Test after each change
   ├─ Verify build succeeds
   └─ Check related features

6. Document progress
   ├─ Update status file
   ├─ Record what was done
   ├─ Note any issues found
   └─ Commit with clear message
```

---

## ⚠️ RISK ASSESSMENT

### Before Modifying Any File

Ask yourself:
1. **What imports this file?**
   ```bash
   grep -rn "import.*filename" src/
   grep -rn "require.*filename" src/
   ```

2. **What components depend on this?**
   ```bash
   grep -rn "ComponentName" src/
   ```

3. **What services use this?**
   ```bash
   grep -rn "functionName" src/
   ```

4. **Could this change break something?**
   - If YES → Verify all dependents
   - If UNSURE → Ask for confirmation
   - If NO → Proceed carefully

### High-Risk Files (Need Extra Care)
- `src/App.jsx` - Main routing, touches everything
- `src/lib/supabase.js` - Database connection, used everywhere
- `src/lib/remittanceService.js` - Core business logic
- `src/lib/zelleService.js` - Payment logic
- `src/components/UserPanel.jsx` - Navigation hub
- Database migration files - Cannot be undone easily

### Medium-Risk Files (Be Careful)
- Any service file
- Any context/provider
- Component that many others import
- Translation files (affects all languages)

### Low-Risk Files (OK to modify)
- Single-use components
- Utility functions with no dependencies
- Styling-only changes
- Documentation

---

## 🔧 SPECIFIC BEHAVIORS

### When Restoring Components
1. Check git history for deleted files
2. Get full implementation from git
3. Create/restore file exactly as before
4. Verify imports match
5. Check if file needs updates for dependencies
6. Test build
7. Test component functionality

### When Fixing Bugs
1. Reproduce the bug first
2. Understand root cause
3. Find minimal fix (don't refactor while fixing)
4. Test fix works
5. Test nothing else broke
6. Commit with clear explanation

### When Adding Features
1. Plan the feature completely
2. Create in isolated branch (local)
3. Implement step by step
4. Test after each step
5. Integrate with existing code carefully
6. Full end-to-end testing
7. Document in status file

### When Consolidating Documentation
1. Read all related md files
2. Extract key information
3. Organize by category
4. Eliminate duplicates
5. Update cross-references
6. Delete redundant files
7. Verify links still work

## 📊 DECISION MATRIX

### "Should I modify file X?"

```
┌─────────────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────────┐
│ Question            │ YES → OK     │ NO → ASK FIRST   │
├─────────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────────┤
│ Did I check for     │ OK to modify │ Need to search   │
│ dependencies?       │              │ first            │
├─────────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────────┤
│ Could this impact   │ Proceed      │ Plan testing     │
│ other areas?        │ carefully    │ first            │
├─────────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────────┤
│ Am I certain of     │ Proceed      │ Research more    │
│ the change?         │              │ or ask           │
├─────────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────────┤
│ Will build still    │ Yes, safe    │ Need to verify   │
│ work after?         │              │ first            │
├─────────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────────┤
│ Are there tests     │ Can test     │ Manual test      │
│ I can run?          │ after change │ required         │
└─────────────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────────┘
```

If ANY answer is uncertain → **ASK FOR CONFIRMATION**

- ❌ Modify code without reading it first
- ❌ Delete files without recovery option
- ❌ Assume dependencies don't exist
- ❌ Commit without building/testing
- ❌ Leave console.log statements from debugging

- ❌ Refactor while fixing bugs
- ❌ Mix multiple unrelated changes in one commit
- ❌ Assume a file is not used
- ❌ Skip testing related features
- ❌ Ignore error messages
- ❌ Work in automatic mode without verification
- ❌ Break functionality to make small improvements

### Always Do This
- ✅ Read before modifying
- ✅ Check for dependencies
- ✅ Test after changes
- ✅ Commit often with clear messages

## 🎯 PRIORITY HIERARCHY

When multiple tasks exist, prioritize:

1. **CRITICAL** (Blocks workflow)
   - Fix broken features
   - Restore missing critical components
   - Resolve security issues
   - Fix database errors

2. **HIGH** (Impacts users)
   - Complete incomplete workflows
   - Fix UI/UX issues
   - Add missing navigation
   - Improve performance

3. **MEDIUM** (Improves quality)
   - Code refactoring
   - Documentation updates
   - Testing improvements
   - Code organization

4. **LOW** (Nice to have)
   - Styling improvements
   - Code comments
   - Non-essential features
   - Performance optimizations

## 💭 MINDSET

### Work Like This
- Be methodical and deliberate
- Think before acting
- Verify before committing
- Document as you go
- Test constantly
- Ask questions
- Be respectful of prior work
- Focus on safety over speed
- Build on successes
- Learn from mistakes

### Avoid This Mindset
- "This should work"
- "I'll test later"
- "Probably safe to change"
- "No one uses this file"
- "I'll document it later"
- "Speed is more important"
- "One small change won't hurt"
- "I'm sure this won't break anything"

---

## 📝 TEMPLATE FOR UNCERTAIN DECISIONS

When you're unsure, use this format to ask:

```
🤔 Need Confirmation

Action I'm considering:
- Modify file: [filename]
- Change: [what you want to change]
- Reason: [why you want to change it]

Potential impact:
- Files that import this: [list]
- Components that depend on this: [list]
- Risk level: [high/medium/low]

Questions:
1. Is it safe to modify this file?
2. Could this break [related feature]?
3. Should I approach this differently?

What I need from you:
- Confirmation to proceed
- Alternative approach
- More information
```

## 🎓 LEARNING & IMPROVEMENT

### Document Issues Found
When you discover issues:
1. Add to PROJECT_DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md
2. Mark severity and category
3. Document root cause
4. Propose solution
5. Update when fixed

### Share Knowledge
When you learn something useful:
1. Add to DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md if it's a rule
2. Add to PROJECT_DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md if it's project-specific
3. Keep it organized by category
4. Make it reusable for next session

### Continuous Improvement
- Review past decisions
- Learn from mistakes
- Improve processes
- Document improvements
- Share with team

---

## ⏱️ TIME MANAGEMENT

### Per-Task Timeframe
- Planning: 10-20% of time
- Implementation: 50-60% of time
- Testing: 15-20% of time
- Documentation: 5-10% of time

### When to Stop and Ask
- Spent 30 min on one fix → Verify approach
- Stuck for 15 min → Ask for help
- Not sure about impact → Ask before proceeding
- Multiple solutions → Ask which is preferred

### Batch Similar Work
- Fix multiple related bugs together
- Update all related docs together
- Test all related features together
- Commit related changes together
