# Testing & Memory - Papuenvios Project

## üß† Project Memory (Current State)

### Last Working Session: 2025-10-01

#### ‚úÖ What Was Fixed Today

1. **Category CRUD Complete Overhaul**
   - Issue: Edit created duplicates instead of updating
   - Issue: Delete failed with UUID error (22P02)
   - Issue: Button always said "Nueva Categor√≠a" when editing
   - Fix: Separated UUID (database) from slug (display)
   - Fix: Added bilingual support throughout
   - Fix: Added description fields (ES/EN)
   - Fix: Auto-generate slug from name
   - Status: ‚úÖ WORKING

2. **BusinessContext Provider Error**
   - Issue: "useBusiness must be used within a BusinessProvider"
   - Issue: React Helmet deprecated lifecycle warnings
   - Fix: Replaced react-helmet with react-helmet-async
   - Fix: Fixed context validation (undefined vs null)
   - Fix: Added ErrorBoundary component
   - Fix: Added error state tracking
   - Status: ‚úÖ WORKING

3. **Database Schema & RLS**
   - Added: slug column to product_categories
   - Fixed: RLS policies for all public tables
   - Fixed: Admin CRUD permissions
   - Fixed: Order access policies
   - Status: ‚úÖ CONFIGURED

#### üéØ Current Architecture Understanding

**Data Flow:**
```
User Action
  ‚Üì
Component (VendorPage.jsx)
  ‚Üì
Service Layer (productService.js)
  ‚Üì
Supabase Client
  ‚Üì
PostgreSQL + RLS
  ‚Üì
Response
  ‚Üì
Context Update (BusinessContext)
  ‚Üì
UI Re-render
```

**Context Hierarchy:**
```
ErrorBoundary
  ‚Üì
HelmetProvider
  ‚Üì
LanguageProvider
  ‚Üì
BusinessProvider
  ‚Üì
AuthProvider
    ‚Üì
  App Components
```

**ID Management:**
- UUID: Used for ALL database operations (CRUD)
- Slug: Used for display, URLs, human-readable IDs
- Never mix them!

#### üîë Key Decisions Made

1. **UUID Primary, Slug Secondary**
   - Database ID = UUID (immutable, secure)
   - Display ID = Slug (readable, SEO-friendly)
   - Transform in BusinessContext to provide both

2. **Bilingual Everything**
   - All user text must be in ES/EN
   - Use language context, not hardcoded strings
   - Toast messages, labels, buttons, errors - all bilingual

3. **Auto-Generate Where Possible**
   - Slugs auto-generated from Spanish name
   - SKUs auto-generated with timestamp
   - Display order defaults to 0

4. **Soft Deletes Always**
   - Never hard delete (data integrity)
   - Use is_active = false
   - Allows recovery, maintains relationships

## üéì Testing Best Practices

1. **Test in Both Languages**
   - Always switch language and re-test
   - Verify all text changes

2. **Test Real User Flows**
   - Don't just test individual features
   - Test complete user journeys

3. **Test Error Scenarios**
   - Network failures
   - Invalid input
   - Permissions issues

4. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Empty data
   - Very long strings
   - Special characters
   - Concurrent operations

5. **Test Performance**
   - With slow network
   - With large datasets
   - Repeated operations

6. **Document Everything**
   - What you tested
   - What passed
   - What failed
   - How to reproduce issues

---

**Remember:**
- Testing is not optional
- Manual testing catches what automated tests miss
- Every bug found in testing is one less in production
- Good testing = confident deployment
