## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY

### Core Systems Implemented
1. **Remittance System** - Complete workflow (create, validate, process, deliver, complete)
2. **Payment Proof Management** - Upload, view, validate with signed URLs
3. **Recipient Management** - CRUD with multiple addresses per recipient
4. **Zelle Account Rotation** - Automatic selection based on limits and priority
5. **Dashboard Metrics** - Comprehensive stats for orders and remittances
6. **Storage System** - Private bucket with RLS policies for payment proofs

### Database Tables
- `remittances` - Main remittance orders
- `remittance_types` - Available remittance options
- `recipients` - User-created recipients
- `recipient_addresses` - Multiple addresses per recipient
- `zelle_accounts` - Zelle payment accounts with rotation logic
- `zelle_transaction_history` - Transaction tracking
- `remittance_status_history` - Status change audit trail

### Key Services
- `remittanceService.js` - Core remittance operations
- `recipientService.js` - Recipient CRUD
- `zelleService.js` - Zelle account management
- `shippingService.js` - Shipping zones and costs
- `comboService.js` - Product bundles

## 📝 COMPONENT INVENTORY

### ✅ Restored/Functional Components
- ProvinceSelector.jsx - Province/municipality selector
- RecipientForm.jsx - Recipient creation/editing form
- RecipientSelector.jsx - Smart recipient selector with inline creation
- AdminRemittancesTab.jsx - Admin remittance management
- MyRemittancesPage.jsx - User remittance viewing

## 🔍 KNOWN ISSUES TO INVESTIGATE

1. **Pending Remittance Count** - Shows 0 but remittances may exist in DB
   - Console logging added for diagnosis
   - May be RLS policy issue or status filtering
   - See: DIAGNOSE_PENDING_REMITTANCES.md

2. **Payment Proof Loading** - Sometimes doesn't display in admin
   - Signed URL generation added
   - Error logging implemented
   - See: PAYMENT_PROOF_DEBUG_GUIDE.md

3. **Combo Functionality** - Status unclear, needs verification

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

### CRITICAL (Blocks Remittance Workflow)
1. [ ] Recover FileUploadWithPreview component
2. [ ] Recover ZelleAccountSelector/ZellePaymentInfo component
3. [ ] Create MyRecipientsPage component
4. [ ] Add navigation links in UserPanel
5. [ ] Add routing in App.jsx
6. [ ] Test complete remittance workflow end-to-end

### HIGH (Impacts User Experience)
7. [ ] Verify combo functionality works
8. [ ] Fix pending remittance count display
9. [ ] Test all payment proof scenarios

### MEDIUM (Polish & Optimization)
10. [ ] Optimize bundle size (currently 923+ kB)
11. [ ] Review and clean up console logs
12. [ ] Performance optimization

## 📚 SYSTEM FLOW DIAGRAMS

### Remittance Workflow
```
SendRemittancePage
  ├─ Step 1: Select Type & Amount
  ├─ Step 2: Enter Recipient (or use RecipientSelector)
  ├─ Step 3: Confirm Details

       └─ Redirect to MyRemittancesPage

MyRemittancesPage

  ├─ Confirm delivery
  └─ Complete remittance
```

### Recipient Workflow
```
SendRemittancePage Step 2
  ├─ Option 1: Use RecipientSelector

  ├─ Edit recipient
  ├─ Manage addresses
  └─ Set default address
```
