- [x] Confirmed migration file naming convention
- [x] Validated service layer structure
- [x] Checked existing recipientService and remittanceService

**Outcome:** Foundation validated, ready to proceed with implementation

---

### ✅ PHASE 2: Database Migration [COMPLETE]
**Duration:** SQL schema creation
**Files Created:** 2

**Files:**
1. `supabase/migrations/20250128000000_add_bank_accounts_system.sql` (280+ lines)
2. `supabase/migrations/20250128000000_add_bank_accounts_system.rollback.sql` (rollback script)

**Schema Details:**

**Table 1: `banks`** (Master Data)
- Columns: id, name, swift_code, local_code, country_code, metadata, timestamps
- Indices: Primary key, unique on (swift_code, country_code)

**Table 2: `account_types`** (Master Data - Seeded)
- Columns: id, name, description, metadata, timestamps
- Seeded Values: checking, savings, moneypocket, debit_card
- Indices: Primary key, unique on name

**Table 3: `bank_accounts`** (User Data with Security)
- Columns: id, user_id, bank_id, account_type_id, currency_id, account_number_last4, account_number_hash, account_holder_name, is_active, soft_delete fields, timestamps
- **Security:** Account numbers stored as SHA256(accountNumber + userId) hashes only
- Indices: Primary key, unique on (user_id, bank_id, account_number_hash), index on (user_id, is_active), index on (bank_id)

**Table 4: `recipient_bank_accounts`** (M:N Relationship)
- Columns: id, recipient_id, bank_account_id, is_default, is_active, timestamps
- Purpose: Link recipients to available bank accounts for transfers
- Indices: Primary key, unique on (recipient_id, bank_account_id), index on (recipient_id, is_active), index on (bank_account_id)

**Table 5: `remittance_bank_transfers`** (Transaction Record)
- Columns: id, remittance_id, recipient_bank_account_id, status, processed_by_user_id, processed_at, amount_transferred, error_message, timestamps
- **Status Lifecycle:** pending → confirmed → transferred / failed / reversed
- **Audit Trail:** processed_by_user_id, processed_at (auto-set on status change)
- Indices: Primary key, unique on remittance_id, indices on status, processed_at, and composite (status, created_at)

**RLS Policies Implemented:**
- User isolation: Users can only access own bank accounts
- Admin privileges: Only admins can process bank transfers
- Recipient access: Only recipient owner can link accounts

**Outcome:** Complete schema with 15+ indices, RLS policies, and seed data

## Security Validation

### Encryption & Hashing
- [x] Account numbers hashed with SHA256(accountNumber + userId)
- [x] Only last 4 digits stored in plain text for display
- [x] Hash uniqueness constraint prevents duplicate account registration

### Data Access Control
- [x] Row-Level Security policies for user isolation
- [x] Admin-only policy for transfer processing
- [x] Recipient-specific account access enforcement

### Audit Trail
- [x] Soft delete pattern with deleted_at and deleted_by_user_id
- [x] Transfer processing tracked with processed_by_user_id
- [x] Automatic timestamp tracking on status changes

### Data Integrity
- [x] Foreign key constraints with CASCADE and RESTRICT options
- [x] Unique constraints for account deduplication
- [x] Status validation with enum-like TypeScript types

---

## Implementation Decisions & Rationale

### 1. Schema Design Improvements (vs. Initial Proposal)

**Change:** Renamed `bank_account_types` → `account_types`
- **Rationale:** Clarity and shorter table names, less redundancy

**Change:** Moved `currency_id` to `bank_accounts` table
- **Rationale:** Each account has a specific currency, improves query efficiency

**Change:** Added `recipient_bank_accounts` link table
- **Rationale:** Supports M:N relationship (one recipient, multiple accounts; one account, multiple recipients)

**Change:** Enhanced transfer record with audit fields
- **Rationale:** Enterprise-grade transaction tracking for compliance

### 2. Security Implementation Choices

**Decision:** Hash account numbers with user ID included
- **Alternative Rejected:** Simple SHA256(accountNumber)
- **Rationale:** Prevents rainbow table attacks, enables per-user account lookup if needed

**Decision:** Store only last 4 digits in plain text
- **Alternative Rejected:** Store full account number encrypted
- **Rationale:** Minimal exposure surface, sufficient for user verification

**Decision:** Soft delete pattern instead of hard delete
- **Alternative Rejected:** Hard delete with cascade
- **Rationale:** Preserves audit trail, enables account recovery, maintains historical data for compliance

### 3. Service Layer Architecture

**Decision:** Separate `bankService.js` for master data
- **Rationale:** Master data operations distinct from user/transaction operations, enables caching

**Decision:** Extend existing `recipientService` and `remittanceService`
- **Rationale:** Keeps related functionality together, maintains existing patterns

**Decision:** Standard error response format { success, data, error }
- **Rationale:** Consistent with existing codebase, easy error handling

- [x] Hash function correctness (account number + user ID)
- [x] Soft delete filtering
- [x] Default account management logic
- [x] Status transition validation

### Integration Test Ready
- [x] RLS policy enforcement
- [x] Foreign key constraint validation
- [x] Transaction atomicity for transfers
- [x] Audit trail recording

### E2E Test Ready

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Backup production database
- [ ] Review migration file for any data type issues
- [ ] Test rollback script on staging environment
- [ ] Set up monitoring for new tables (query performance, storage)
- [ ] Configure RLS policies in production environment
- [ ] Seed bank master data (banks, account types) in production

### During Deployment

- [ ] Apply migration: `supabase migration up`
- [ ] Verify all tables created: `SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables`
- [ ] Verify indices created: `SELECT * FROM pg_indexes`
- [ ] Verify RLS policies active: `SELECT * FROM pg_policies`
- [ ] Seed account types if not auto-seeded

### Post-Deployment

- [ ] Monitor database for any constraint violations
- [ ] Test service layer functions with real data
- [ ] Verify RLS policies with test user accounts
- [ ] Load test pending transfer queries

### Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Backup current data from new tables (if needed)
2. Execute rollback: `supabase migration down`
3. Verify rollback: `SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables` (should not show new tables)
4. Restore from backup if necessary
